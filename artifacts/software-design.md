# Software Design and Engineering

## Original and Enhanced Artifact
- [Original Code](../Grocery%20Tracker%20Original/)
- [Enhanced Code](../CS499_GroceryItemTracker/)

## Narrative Addressing Enhancements
**Enhancements Implemented:**  
1. Brief Description of the Artifact
The artifact I chose for my ePortfolio is the Grocery Store Item Tracker, a command-line application initially developed in C++ during my CS-210 Programming Languages course. Created on August 11, 2023, this program reads a list of grocery items from a text file, tracks the frequency of each item, and provides options for users to view item frequencies and a frequency histogram. The project was my introduction to data handling in C++, covering foundational concepts such as file I/O, frequency mapping, and user interaction through a menu-driven interface.

2. Justification for Including the Artifact
I selected the Grocery Store Item Tracker for my ePortfolio because it effectively showcases my skills in software engineering and adaptability to new languages and design principles. The original artifact demonstrates my ability to:
•	Handle data using maps (equivalent to dictionaries in Python).
•	Structure code modularly to promote clarity and future scalability.
•	Implement user-friendly features, like frequency tracking and histogram display.
The enhancement involved porting the program to Python, improving its readability and usability by adopting Pythonic conventions and implementing a case-insensitive search. This transformation underscores my adaptability in software development, highlighting my ability to transition a project between languages while preserving and enhancing its functionality.

3. Meeting Course Outcomes
The enhancement aligned with the course outcomes I set out to achieve in Module One, including:
Outcome 3:
"Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)."
Porting the program from C++ to Python required me to evaluate the original design, manage trade-offs between language-specific features, and improve functionality. For example, I replaced C++ maps with Python dictionaries, which streamlined the program's structure and enhanced its usability.
Outcome 4:
"Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)."
During the enhancement, I applied Pythonic design principles and leveraged Python’s standard libraries for file handling. Additionally, I implemented a case-insensitive search to improve user experience and program functionality. These improvements added significant value by making the program more efficient, readable, and user-friendly.
Outcome 5:
"Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources."
To ensure the program's reliability, I added error handling for file operations. This enhancement allows the program to gracefully handle runtime issues, such as missing or invalid files, mitigating potential failures and improving overall security.


4. Reflection on the Enhancement Process
The enhancement process from C++ to Python was both challenging and rewarding. I learned to adopt Python’s design conventions, emphasizing readability and simplicity. One of the main challenges was translating C++-specific constructs, like maps, into their Python equivalents while preserving the integrity of the original design. Additionally, I enhanced the user experience by implementing a case-insensitive search, which required me to rethink how data was stored and retrieved.
Overall, this project deepened my understanding of modular design, file handling, and error management across languages. It also strengthened my problem-solving skills as I navigated the differences between C++ and Python. This artifact not only represents my proficiency in software development but also my commitment to refining and evolving my skills, making it a meaningful addition to my ePortfolio.

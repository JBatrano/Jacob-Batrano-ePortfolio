# Welcome to My ePortfolio

Hi, I’m Jacob Batrano, and this portfolio showcases my growth in:
- **Software Design and Engineering**
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- **Databases**

## Professional Self-Assessment

My journey into computer science started with curiosity and self-taught development. Before entering this program, I was building blockchain solutions without a formal foundation. I was figuring things out on my own but knew I needed to strengthen my fundamentals to truly excel. From writing my first "Hello, World!" in Python to developing advanced solutions with databases, algorithms, and machine learning, this program has given me the tools to grow as a well-rounded developer.


Building My Foundation:

When I began this degree, I was eager to fill the gaps in my knowledge. I started small, learning core programming concepts in Python and quickly leveled up to larger, more complex systems. Some of my most notable achievements include:
•	Full-Stack Development with JavaScript: Building dynamic, user-friendly web applications using front-end and back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. These projects helped me manage the full Software Development Lifecycle, from design to deployment.
•	Database Development: Creating robust data banks using SQL and integrating data seamlessly into web applications with MongoDB.
•	C++ Game Room Project: Developing a web-based multiplayer game room that showcased my ability to combine programming logic with user interactivity.
•	Machine Learning Exploration: Applying reinforcement learning principles in my CartPole project, where I enhanced agent performance using reward shaping, adaptive learning rates, and state normalization.


Practical Experience Across the SDLC:

One of the highlights of my program was learning to navigate the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I had the opportunity to play every role—from developer to tester, Scrum Master, and project manager while building full-stack applications. I collaborated with stakeholders to understand their goals, communicated progress, and delivered functional solutions that met their expectations.
These experiences not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught me how to adapt to shifting priorities, manage workflows, and ensure that every stage of a project was completed with quality.


From Fundamentals to the Future:

This program has expanded my perspective on what’s possible with technology. I’ve grown from self-taught experimentation to confidently building scalable solutions. I particularly enjoyed exploring machine learning and its potential to shape the future of technology. Combining this knowledge with my passion for problem solving, I’m now focused on transitioning into the ServiceNow ecosystem, where I can leverage my skills to develop meaningful solutions for businesses.


How My Artifacts Fit Together:

This portfolio reflects my growth as a developer and my commitment to continuous learning. Each artifact demonstrates a specific area of my expertise:
•	Software Design and Engineering: Building adaptable and modular solutions with Python and C++.
•	Algorithms and Data Structures: Optimizing machine learning projects for performance and stability.
•	Databases: Designing secure, efficient systems for data management with SQLlite and 
Together, these artifacts showcase my ability to take on complex challenges, design innovative solutions, and deliver high-quality work.

Looking Ahead:

This degree has provided me with a strong foundation in software engineering, algorithms, and database management, but it’s only the beginning. I’m excited to bring these skills into the ServiceNow ecosystem, where I can combine my technical expertise with my ability to collaborate, adapt, and deliver value.
